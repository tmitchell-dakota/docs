## HTTP Requests

HTTP requests can be sent using a variety of software, and the exact structure of a request may vary. A request typically consists of the following four parts:

1. **HTTP Method**
2. **Headers**
3. **Request Body** (not required for GET requests)
4. **Response** (indicating the outcome, such as success).
