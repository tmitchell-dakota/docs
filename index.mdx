## API Reference & Purpose

The Marketplace API is based on the REST API architecture, which provides a standardized and simple way to access Marketplace data without relying on a user interface. Using this API, you can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and integrate Marketplace data with other applications to meet business needs.

The REST API works by sending HTTP calls to specific endpoints. Each call interacts with a resource such as a record, collection of records, query result, metadata, or API-related information.

Compared to SOAP APIs, the REST API is simpler, requires less tooling, and still provides a wide range of functionality.

## HTTP Requests

A request typically consists of four parts:

1. **HTTP Method** – Defines the type of operation (e.g., POST, GET)
2. **Headers** – Provide request details such as authorization and format
3. **Request Body** – Contains data (not required for GET requests)
4. **Response** – The server's reply, indicating success or failure

## Base URL

All API calls use the following Base URL:

```
https://marketplace-as-a-service.herokuapp.com/index.php/
```

**Example:** `POST https://marketplace-as-a-service.herokuapp.com/index.php/`

## Headers

The Marketplace REST API supports standard and custom headers. Commonly used headers include:

- **Content-Type** – Defines the request body format (e.g., `application/json`, `application/xml`)
- **Accept** – Defines the expected response format. Default: `application/json`
- **Authorization** – Provides the OAuth 2.0 access token for client authorization
- **Compression** – Compresses the request
- **Conditional Request** – Validates requests against preconditions

## Request Body

The request body allows you to add new records or update existing fields.

- **Format:** JSON or XML

## HTTP Status Codes

- **200 OK** – The request was successful
- **400 Bad Request** – Malformed syntax; request could not be processed
- **401 Unauthorized** – Authentication required
- **500 Internal Server Error** – Unexpected condition on the server
